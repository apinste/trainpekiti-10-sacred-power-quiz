# Pekiti Tirsia Kali DC/MD/VA — 10 Sacred Power Quiz

This repository hosts the **10 Sacred Power Quiz**, an interactive assessment designed to help practitioners identify which inner power is most active in their life right now. The quiz blends Filipino Martial Arts principles with somatic awareness, cyclical intelligence, and modern learning psychology.

The quiz uses:
- **20 medium‑depth questions**  
- **4 core rhythms** (A/B/C/D)  
- A mapping system that expands into **10 Sacred Powers**  
- A dual‑path interpretation: **Feminine Path** and **Masculine Path**  
- A clean, single‑page interface where the quiz disappears and results appear dynamically

## How It Works

- Each question has **four answer choices** (A/B/C/D).  
- These map to **four rhythms**:  
  - A = Cyclical Intelligence  
  - B = Relational Leadership  
  - C = Somatic Intuition  
  - D = Emotional Alchemy  
- The scoring system identifies:  
  - **Primary Rhythm**  
  - **Emerging Rhythm**  
  - **Shadow Rhythm**  
- These rhythms expand into the **10 Sacred Powers**, which are interpreted through the chosen path.
